# 🌌 5D Diplomacy: Multiverse Time Travel

_A strategic experiment where timelines, logic, and paradoxes collide._

---

## 🧠 About the Project

**5D Diplomacy** is a reimagined version of the classic strategy game —  
expanded into the **multiverse**, where every move echoes through multiple timelines.

This fork, **Curiosity Edition**, explores:
- distributed time mechanics  
- paradox resolution algorithms  
- and the architecture of self-consistent worlds

> _Can negotiation survive causality loops?_

## 🏗 Architecture Overview

The engine models **parallel timelines** as distributed states connected through  
a **consensus layer** that resolves paradoxes between conflicting outcomes.

## 🚀 Development Roadmap

| Milestone | Goal | Status |
|------------|------|--------|
| **v0.1 — Causal Core** | Timeline simulation engine and paradox logic | ✅ Done |
| **v0.2 — Multiverse Negotiation** | Async agents and cross-timeline diplomacy | 🧩 In Progress |
| **v0.3 — Visualization Sandbox** | Interactive simulation UI | ⏳ Planned |
| **v1.0 — Playable Simulation** | Multiplayer paradox-resilient state | 🚀 Planned |

## 💡 Philosophy

> “Every decision you make creates another you — negotiating for control.”

The project is both a **technical exploration** and a **philosophical experiment**  
about determinism, agency, and the limits of consensus in distributed worlds.
